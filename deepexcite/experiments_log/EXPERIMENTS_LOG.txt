- resnet/version_399:
	- After increasing the number of filters to 16 
	  performs really well on 1 output frame

- resnet/version_476:
	- Added validation.
	- Training on "spiral_params3.hdf5" and "three_points_params3"
          validating on "heartbeat_params3.hdf5".
        - Performs well, does not overfit.

- resnet/version_513:
	- Added random noise for data augmentation.
	- We observe, considered also other runs, that as soon as 
	  the learning rate is scaled down to 1e-4, the training is more stable.
	- The models learns denoising well
	- Does not overfit, validation performance is very good
	
- resnet/version_667:
	- Training is now performed by incrementing the number of output frames when the loss reaches a certain treshold
	- The model fit reeeeaally well on the training set.
	- There must be a bug because the validation dataset is stuck at predicting only one frame.

- resnet/version_5
	- Training with 3 frames as input to test the idea that 2 frames can only predict velocity whilst 3 frames can predict acceleration as well.
	  The idea is that the higher the number of input frames, the higher the order of variabile able to be predicted
	- Training goes well, does not overfit, also learns better long term dependencies.
	  Proper test for acceleration still to be designed.
