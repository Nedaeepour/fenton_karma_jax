- resnet/version_399:
	- After increasing the number of filters to 16 
	  performs really well on 1 output frame

- resnet/version_476:
	- Added validation. Training on "spiral_params3.hdf5" and "three_points_params3"
          validating on "heartbeat_params3.hdf5".
          Performs well, does not overfit.

- resnet/version_513:
	- Added random noise for data augmentation.
	  We observe, considered also other runs, that as soon as 
	  the learning rate is scaled down to 1e-4, the training is more stable
